ABM_full
ABM_full_1 = Removed any interaction between cps proficient levels and establishing a shared understanding. Common ground is sampled from a binom(1, 0.5) i.e. 0.5 prob of common ground for each team each round

ABM_full_2 = roles are distributed each round with an equal probability of each role in the team being assigned for each round of solving in a tick.
Prob(role)=1/len(team_members)

full_2.5 = roles are distributed to correct role with prob=1
